<strong>Re-Authorization</strong>
<p><strong>Days of Authorized Availability</strong> - Enter into this box how many days your customer will be  a member of the specified role (subscription length).  Leaving blank will assume that the availability does not expire.
</p>
<p><em>Note: </em>If your subscription length is limited, you should include the day limit in this box, whether there is a re-authorization cycle or not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Re-authorization Cycle</strong> - This is the frequency you wish AreteX to check the validity of your customer's authorization.  For example, a "Daily" re-authorization would have AreteX check every 24 hours.  If your customer cancelled his or her subscription, that customer would revert to your chosen Role at Expiration within 24 hours.  If you choose "Monthly" here, AreteX will check for valid authorization every month.  
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> "Single" in this instance means that AreteX will not check for a valid Authorization after the initial delivery.</p>
