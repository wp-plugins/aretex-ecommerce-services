<strong>Edit Offer Code - Help</strong>
<p>
<strong>Offer Code </strong>- The Offer Code needs to be a unique combination of letters and/or numbers 
(not exceeding 7 characters). As you are editing, the Offer Code assigned is locked. <br/>
<strong>Description - </strong> You may write your own description or leave it blank.  If you leave this box blank 
AreteX will create a description for you, based on your choices on this screen.<br/>
<strong>Expiration Date - </strong> Either fill in the date (yyyy/mm/dd) you wish your offer to 
expire or leave blank.  If you leave this box blank, AreteX will assume that this offer does not expire.<br/>
<strong>Offer Type - </strong> '<em>Access</em>' - The Offer <em>may</em> be used to limit/allow access to a 
product, but price stays the same. (See <em>WP Integration</em> for details.)This Offer Type can be used for generic tracking.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'<em>Percent Discount</em>' - Offer is for a discounted price.<br />
<strong>Amount</strong> - You only fill this in for a % Discount -- enter what your % discount is.<br />
<strong>Applies To</strong> - If you wish to limit this offer to a specific product(s), select <em>Specific 
Products</em>, and choose your product(s) below. (See Product Search box.)<br />
<strong>Commission Groups</strong> - Only members of the selected commision group can make the 
offer.  (Use Ctrl+Mouse Click or Shift+Mouse Click to select multiple Commission Groups.)
If nobody is selected, the Offer will be available to all, based upon particular commission group limitations.<br />
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If no commission group has been created, none will appear on the scrolling Commission Groups list.  
The Offer you create will be a general offer you wish wish to give all your customers, especially if you have no 
commission or affiliate payees (Referrers).</p>
