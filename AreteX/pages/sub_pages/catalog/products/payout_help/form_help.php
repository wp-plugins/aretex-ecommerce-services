<p><strong>Payment Type:</strong> Tells contributors why they are being paid. (i.e. Royalty, Teaching Fee...) name this appropriately, as there may be tax implications for you or the contributor.</p>
<p><strong>Amount/Paid On: </strong>Enter the amount you will pay, based on your "Paid on" choice. If <em>Fixed Amount</em> - Amount will be paid each sale.  If <em>Percent Gross</em>, Amount will be used to compute payment based solely on the price of the product. If <em>Percent Net</em>, it is the percentage after known expenses (including commisssions and AreteX&trade; fees) are subtracted from the product price.

<li><strong>Amount:</strong> <em>1</em>; <strong>Paid On:</strong> <em>Fixed</em> - Contributor will be paid $1.00 per sale or re-bill.</li>
