<h3>Manual Batch Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Manual Batch</strong> is the ability you have as an owner to pay your contributors and referrers outside of the automatic ACH/Direct Deposit functionality of AreteX.  This ability would be most important if an irregularity occurs with your or your payee's bank account of record, which would not allow Direct Deposit to be used.
</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>:</em> This feature lets you have AreteX&trade; continue to automatically figure the payments you owe, download a spreadsheet of payments due, and to record these payments you make.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: For Manual Batch to work, an ACH authorization cannot be on file for that payee.  </p>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Payments Due</strong> tab allows you to input the criteria you wish to use in searching for payments you need to make.  The listing can be by individual or for all payees.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Batches Marked Paid</strong> tab lets you see a report of all payments you have made yourself, outside of the automated ACH/Direct Deposit functionality.  The report of ACH payments may be found in the <strong>ACH Report</strong> tab.</p>
