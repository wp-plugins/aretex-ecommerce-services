<h2>Form Customization Overview</h2>
<div class="section group"> <!-- ROW -->

<p><strong>Form Customization</strong> is about matching the <em>Look and Feel</em> of your WordPress site or theme with the forms and email notifications seen by your customer. This section of the AreteX&trade; WordPress plugin is most useful to web designers and theme developers.</p> 
<p><strong>Style Sheets:</strong> Most of the Look and Feel matching is accomplished when you modify two stylesheets:
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;One for <strong>Receipts &amp; Other Customer Notifications</strong> (Including Customer Account Access)
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;One for the <strong>Payment Form</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Receipts &amp; Customer Accounts:</strong> AreteX&trade; sends email notifications to your customers on your behalf when certain payment events occur. (For example, a receipt or cancellation notice).
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;"><p><strong>Receipts</strong> - Enter your customer service information on this tab. You will also be able to see what the current receipt looks like based on your stylesheet.</p></div>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;"><p><strong>Customer Account Manager (<em>CAM</em>):</strong> The CAM provides your customers with a way to view their purchase history and manage their rebill agreements. 
<br /><em>Enable CAM</em> - If you enable <em>Customer Account Management</em>, AreteX&trade; will automatically send a "Welcome" email to your customer 
to explain how to access their CAM.  This is very site specific. You <em>should modify</em> the welcome email for your specific business.</p> 
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;"><p><strong>Help and Information:</strong> - This tab has detailed documentation <em>and diagrams</em> to show you how your CSS stylesheet maps to each notification form.
<strong>Notification Samples</strong> lets you see what each notification will look like to your customer - and includes the ability to <em>email a sample</em> to yourself.</p></div>

     <strong>Payment Form</strong>
     <p>The <em>Payment Form</em> tab allows you to customize your PCI Compliant Payment Form on the AreteX&trade; server. You may select which credit cards you accept
     as well as setting up your branding information and a stylesheet to match your site.</p>
     <p>There is also a <strong>Help and Information</strong> tab under the Payment Form tab.  
     It has extensive documentation on customizing the Payment Form. </p>
