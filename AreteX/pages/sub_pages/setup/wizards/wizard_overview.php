<h3>Wizard Overview</h3>
<p>
We have provided two wizards to help you get a "quick and easy" win.  The setup provided in each of these wizards will help you understand the basic process involved in either a Paid Content product offering, or a Paid Membership/Subscription service.
</p>
<p>When your wizards are finished, they will save your information to the AreteX&trade; database.  
You may view this saved information by going to <em>Catalog &amp; Products / Products.</em></p>



<h4>Paid Content Wizard</h4>
<p>
"Paid Content" deals with setting up your digital products in order to have an on-line store front.  This wizard is a very basic setup.  You can use this wizard to initially set up your individual products, then edit the information at a later time to make full use of the options AreteX offers.
</p>
<p>The last page of the Paid Content Wizard is the "shortcode" for your product. You may want to copy 
and paste it for later. There are three other ways to get to/create the shortcodes:
<ol>
<li>Go to the <em>Catalog &amp; Products / Delivery Specifications / Deliverables</em>.  Choose Paid Content for editing (pencil icon). Select the "WP Shortcode" button. </li>
<li>Go to the WordPress Page/Post editor on your admin panel. Add or Edit your WordPress Page or Post.  Select the AreteX&trade; Editor button. Follow the prompts.</li>
<li>Go to the <em>WP Integration / Shortcodes &amp; Widget / Product Presentation / Paid Content</em>. Follow the instructions to create your own.  </li>
</ol></p>


<h4>Paid Membership Wizard</h4>
<p>
"Paid Membership" deals with the integration of the AreteX&trade; billing functions with <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities" target="_blank">WordPress Roles &amp; Capabilties</a> functionality.
</p>
<p>In order to fully utilize the Membership features of AreteX&trade; you should also have a Role/Member manager plugin, such as those listed in the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#Resources" target="_blank">Roles and Capabilities Resources</a>. </p>

<p>The last page of the Paid Content Wizard is the "shortcode" for your product. You may want to copy and paste it for later.</p>
